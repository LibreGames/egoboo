I propose that we use astyle to auto-format the code


The current code is formatted with the command

	astyle --mode=ansi -t4T4yCSKNwpoOX

which comes closest to what xenom has proposed.


astyle is available on all linux systems. It can be downloaded and installed on win32 systems from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html.

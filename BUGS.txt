Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums
at: http://egoboo.sourceforge.net/forum/ 

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- No way to introduce the Spider Lair quest.
- A rare random crash bug (NaN with some math operation)
- Rework how identifying stuff works. Currently it doesn't work at all.
- Abyss 1 is unbeatable. When I kill one of the minotaurs the game slows down and then freezes 
- Tourist: one of the keys ( at platforms) always fell trough the platform to the pit. that makes this level unbeatable. 
- "items falls through the floor" bug
- Redo some of the Devil Door stuff (detect dead)
- Trigger Tiles move through players.
- Xbows and Longbows have horrible attack range as the arrows hit ground too early
- Archmage Trials: After solving the mirror puzzle (with the minotaur) my character gets supersized. 
- In the tourist starter the spike traps are hurting the character even when he doesn't touches them. (They hurt even when standing some steps away...) 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Unlocking the door of the Cobol Mage room does not work; you can walk through the - still visible - door after "unlocking" it, but the middle part is not trespassable. 

COSMETIC/TRIVIAL 
- Starting equipment is not properly unkursed
- Fix those black tile artifacts on the bottom of the camera.
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- Need magic sparks for the sporks attacks.
- Backstab messages in the ticker are displayed twice.

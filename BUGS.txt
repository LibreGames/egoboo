Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- Trigger Tiles move through players.
- Xbows and Longbows have horrible attack range as the arrows hit ground too early
- Imprisoned One II: After defeating the sand troll there appears no staff.
- Archmage Trials: After solving the mirror puzzle (with the minotaur) my character gets supersized. 
- Archmage Trials: After fighting the viking an invisible wall blocks my path. So i can't talk to the door. 
- In the tourist starter the spike traps are hurting the character even when he doesn't touches them. (They hurt even when standing some steps away...) 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Petrified trolls are sometimes invulnerable. I don't know if that particular example was already dead and simply didn't poof (the doors opened), but I could damage it neither with a mallet nor with a Ring of Flames spell (that instantly kills it otherwise). 
- Unlocking the door of the Cobol Mage room does not work; you can walk through the - still visible - door after "unlocking" it, but the middle part is not trespassable. 

COSMETIC/TRIVIAL 
- Whips attack too fast.
- Starting equipment is not properly unkursed
- Scorpions lose their claws against crushing weapons
- Fix those black tile artifacts on the bottom of the camera.
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- There is something glitchy with animations. Check the dimlock assassins for example.
- Lance animation while riding is buggy.
- Identify doesn't properly work - the scroll is always reported as wasted, and the name of the object isn't made known. Tested with the bracelet at Sand Palace and the kursed broadsword of Ice Palace. 
- Need magic sparks for the sporks attacks.
- The "monster" from Imprisoned One is seemingly able to fly. It flings itself through the room and spams its poison bubbles on you. 
* Ghouls in Shadow Palace rise either extremely fast or not at all. 
* If you step on a dead Darkshine Knight, you see a floating message of "Blocked". 
* Backstab messages in the ticker are displayed twice. 
* Stalkers in Shadow Palace are not spawned.
* Shuffling Heaps either move extremely fast or very very [...] very slow.

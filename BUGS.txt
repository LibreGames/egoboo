Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums

Thanks!

MAJOR BUGS:
- Importing still doesn't work on Linux
- Menu interface bug in Linux see -> http://a.imageshack.us/img829/5305/ego11.png

GENERAL BUGS:
- Movement is a bit difficult after jumping.
- The Missile spell did not spawn missiles in Adventurer Starter.
- Seems to be a draw offset for shadows and reflections.
- Picking up a torch makes the torch being held as if it was on the floor until you use it at least once.
- Braziers tend to hurt nearby characters too easily.
- Stalkers in Shadow Palace are not spawned.
- Basically, Combat Blessing is extremely buggy. It sometimes sets the users life somewhere next to 0 (empty health bar), though it never kills the user itself. Also, it sometimes puts out torches while charging. Also, the divine light effect it casts is sometimes invisible and it sometimes makes grubs (and others? Haven't tested...) invulnerable to your attacks and you invulnerable to theirs (team change?) 
  The problem occured with a 2.7.4 healer with a 2.7.4 rune in 2.8.0, though... not tested with 2.8.0 stuff. 
- If you use the Elf Armor chest in Sand Palace (which contains a tuxedo no matter what you wear when entering the module, btw), it doesn't contain your previous armor afterwards. Coming there with a Dragon Hide means that you're stuck with that stupid Tuxedo, at least for the rest of the module. 
- Petrified trolls are sometimes invulnerable. I don't know if that particular example was already dead and simply didn't poof (the doors opened), but I could damage it neither with a mallet nor with a Ring of Flames spell (that instantly kills it otherwise). 
- If you accidentally take off an amulet/a bracelet/shoes, you will often not put them on by putting them away. To activate them again, you often need to drop then and pick them up. 
- Bishopia: The suspicious mushrooms in Olaf's junkyard can't be picked up. 
- Archmage Trials: After solving the mirror puzzle (with the minotaur) my character gets supersized. 
- Archmage Trials: After fighting the viking an invisible wall blocks my path. So i can't talk to the door. 
- Archmage Trials: The warlock on the chess board (actually only the left one) is attacking the player with magic missiles even when the game hasn't started. 
- In the tourist starter the spike traps are hurting the character even when he doesn't touches them. (They hurt even when standing some steps away...) 
- Imprisoned One II: After defeating the sand troll there appears no staff.
- The elemental demon can sometimes escape his prison without the locks being opened. This makes him also invincible. He's still attacking the player. 
- After being poisoned the green life bar won't turn red again.
- The green potions found in some chests can't be picked up. 
- With the magic carpet I'm able to fly through doors or even walls. I think the velocity of the carpet is too high. It kinda "drills" through the walls. 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- Elf Starter: The A.I. is a little strange. I saw a Lumpkin, with two claws, running into a wall and swiping madly. Not sure what was going on. This also occurred with a Lumpkin on the left side of the fortress. Possible explanation: they were hostile to the crabs? 
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Identify doesn't properly work - the scroll is always reported as wasted, and the name of the object isn't made known. Tested with the bracelet at Sand Palace and the kursed broadsword of Ice Palace. 
- The fire breath from the dogs can and will hurt the rider. 
- There seems to be a texture allocation bug when Restarting a module. Some objects get the skins of other objects. 

BUGS RELATED TO PARTICLE END SPAWN:
- Probably a physics problem, but blood does not dry out very quickly. This is especially noticeable in the Elf module. 
- The rune of confusion is broken. The first time the spell is used there is a purple cloud created for aiming. After using it a second time, there's no cloud displayed. 
- Need magic sparks for the sporks.
- When the character dies he drops some of his coins. This gold shows abnormal behaviour. Everytime the character jumps the coins jump too. 
- The rune of combat blessing is broken. After casting/activating it almost all life points are drawn. Then the sound is played. Then it seems it stucks in an infinite loop resulting in the spell being cast again and again. When being hold the casting costs divine mana when dropped it doesn't. 
- Particle end effects like "sound" or "spawn other particles" doesn't work.
- The "fireball/flame ring seems to throw you through the ceiling, while your inventory stays where it was (but is still properly attached)" (I figured out that this seems to be what it does)
- Whips snap with abnormal speed (~10 snaps per second), at least if wielded by my elf (Dex 28; not tested with others). When wielded by a cobol or any other enemy/NPC, their speed is normal. 
- Whips attack to fast. They also no longer spawn the small white flash.
- Fireballs either just fly around and simply disappear, or they hit enemies in a way much like a missile - a tiny particle blast and the enemy is damaged. 
- Blud of insects, cockatrices and lumpkins still doesn't despawn. The blud of some others, like mosquitos, trogs or cobols, does, though. 
- Particle IfHitGround does not work. 

CRASH BUGS:
- Seems some objects are being loaded twice into the same slot see -> http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/3996/egoerror.jpg
- There appears to be some random crash bugs occuring making it difficult to play through the modules.
- Zombi Starter: A crash often occurs in the third room (probably already known). 
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- In Sand Palace, the game once froze. The ticker (not the in-game ticker, but the DOS window system report thingy) said "spawn_one_enchant() failed because target was not alive" thrice before it happened. 
- In Ash Palace, Ice Palace and Cobol Palace, the game freezes/crashes very often - without any errors in ticker or log except the occasional "spawn_one_enchant() failed because target [...]". In Ice Palace and Cobol Palace, it even sometimes simply quits without any warning and without the OS noticing anything strange. In Ice Palace, the game especially likes to crash when you are battling the Rust Eater. Which extremely sucks and is demotivating. I had already exterminated all its maggots and severely damaged it thrice... and every time, my efforts were ended by the game either freezing or simply collapsing. Otherwise the fight with the rusty would be so much fun...  
- Dead enemies horribly flicker if they are next to a door or inside a wall. Stepping on such a dead character often freezes the game and finally crashes it. 

COSMETIC/TRIVIAL 
- Darkvision skill does not work in Shadow Palace. It is still pitch black. I mostly used missiles for lighting my way... 
- Stealing does not work - if you grab something while invisible or stealthy, the shopkeeper tells you you would lack the money or takes the price as if you were visible. 
- There is a graphical "hiccup" when you change armor. This also occurs when you transform. 
- When you drop the green spell books, they appear as red. I seem to recall a similar problem in the wizard module. 
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- Shadow Palace (often) and Ice Palace (rarely) get a warning: WARN: spawn_one_enchant() - failed because the required enchant owner cannot be found. 
- Ghouls in Shadow Palace rise either extremely fast or not at all. 
- If you step on a dead Darkshine Knight, you see a floating message of "Blocked". 
- Backstab messages in the ticker are displayed twice. 
- You can only move in a single direction while dual wielding (like you can do with katanas or torches). 
- Shuffling Heaps either move extremely fast or very very [...] very slow. 
- Darkshine knights tend to attack walls until you get in close range to them. 
- The "monster" from Imprisoned One is seemingly able to fly. It flings itself through the room and spams its poison bubbles on you. 
- It seems like cobol mages could create ~8 missiles if you don't kill them while they charge. Are they really much more intelligent than my Elf (Int 29, 5 missiles)? 
- If you override something with a Strider, the strider is considered the killer. Done on purpose or a bug? 
- Successful magical unlocking always gives out "Nothing seems to happen" plus "The door is already open." 
- Unlocking the door of the Cobol Mage room does not work; you can walk through the - still visible - door after "unlocking" it, but the middle part is not trespassable.

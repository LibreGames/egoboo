Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums
at: http://egoboo.sourceforge.net/forum/ 

Thanks!

UNCONFIRMED:
1. Frights (flaming skulls) will never be vanquished by “healing” them.
2. The Paladin module seems to be missing the items it needs to be completed; neither the first or second rooms of the sarcophaguses contain keys!
3. Swinging a weapon will cause your character to move slightly. I am un-sure if this is intended.
4. It is almost impossible to get injured by ghouls. Sometimes jumping during their attacks can cause injury, however.
5. Sometimes “Immune” pops up when idols are attacked. I find this misleading, as idols could still be destroyed with the same weapon used præviously.
6. A Healer’s tip contains a typo: “Dont”. “Don’t” or “Do not” would be better.
8. A tranch is missing from one of the first four idols of the Healer module.
9. A tranch is missing in the second chest of the Sand Palace. Although the Sand Palace already has plenty of tranches anyway!
11. Rug mimics are very hard to find because they are usually invisible unless they are attacking.
12. The cursor is not displayïng correctly in specific texture filtering modes
13 It also seems that all foes are more difficult to hit, as direct contact seems to be in-adæquate. Perhaps extensive testing is required.

KNOWN BUGS:
- Restart module removes controls
- Ghouls cannot be harmed by (blunt) weapons, “healing” might be the only way to damage them now. That makes the Healer module considerably tædious.
- The hints seem to be ‘cut’ off my screen, perhaps due to the font size, or my resolution.
- Sometimes the avatars in the playër select will turn into books. Could any of you guess why that might be happening?
- Can't use command keys for input controls (shift ctrl, etc.)
- A rare random crash bug (NaN with some math operation)
- Tourist: one of the keys ( at platforms) always fell trough the platform to the pit. that makes this level unbeatable. 
- "items falls through the floor" bug
- Redo some of the Devil Door stuff (detect dead)
- Trigger Tiles move through players.
- Xbows and Longbows have horrible attack range as the arrows hit ground too early
- Archmage Trials: After solving the mirror puzzle (with the minotaur) my character gets supersized. 
- In the tourist starter the spike traps are hurting the character even when he doesn't touches them. (They hurt even when standing some steps away...) 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Unlocking the door of the Cobol Mage room does not work; you can walk through the - still visible - door after "unlocking" it, but the middle part is not trespassable. 

COSMETIC/TRIVIAL 
- Starting equipment is not properly unkursed
- Fix those black tile artifacts on the bottom of the camera.
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- Need magic sparks for the sporks attacks.
- Backstab messages in the ticker are displayed twice.

WISHLIST:
- Add multiplayer networking
- MESHFX_WALL should become hillside and not impassable while MESH_FXSLIPPERY should become icy.
- Rework how identifying stuff works. Currently it doesn't work at all.

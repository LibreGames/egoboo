- the object/object interaction is not turned on right now

- particles are spawning in the wrong places (the flame on the adventurers torch)

- object/mesh interaction has some problems when you transition between a wall and a 
floor. you can get trapped even though the normal calculation seems to done correctly 
(check the porcupine view)

- some objects still have their normals defined improperly! the knight's shield, for 
instance.  Also, the default normals for the knight's sword are a bit strange since the sword is so thin. There may be a way around this.

- Starting xp for NPC and monsters does not give them level ups

- Object size is not correct. Mephit wings are way bigger and do not move anymore. Deamon Lord too (Uses same model)

- Not sure if this is a bug: If egoboo finds a script error when running a module with the Debug version (as opposed to the release binary),
  the game crashes. (something to do with assert failed in script.c line 478)
  Solution: Running the game in release binary shows where the script error is and you can fix it.

- When loading a saved game, then exiting the saved game, and then
 starting a new player you get a message: "Press space to respawn" and
 
pressing space does nothing.


Workaround: when you want to start a new player after loading a saved game,
completely exit egoboo and start it again.


- Items that are dropped are thrown out with a too high force. While coins do the opposite
when dropped.

- Whenever a spellbook is dropped, it plays the wrong animation sequence. Currently it
runs the spellbok burns away when dropped.

- "killed" objects still run AI scripts.
